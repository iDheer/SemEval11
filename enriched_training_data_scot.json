Step-by-Step Deduction:\n   - From Premise 2, all insects are animals, so B is a subset of A.\n   - From Premise 1, no insects are mammals, so B and C are disjoint.\n   - However, the conclusion claims that all animals are mammals, which would mean A is a subset of C.\n   - Since B is part of A but not part of C, A cannot be entirely contained in C unless B is the only animal, which is not necessarily true based on the premises.\n   - Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, as there are animals (e.g., insects) that are not mammals, and the premises do not establish that all animals are mammals.\n4.

Step-by-Step Deduction:\n   - From Premise 2, we know that if something is an adult, then it is not a man. This means that the set of adults and the set of men have no overlap.\n   - From Premise 1, we know that if something is a man, then it is not a woman. This means that the set of men and the set of women have no overlap.\n   - However, the premises do not establish any direct relationship between adults and women. Since adults are not men, and men are not women, it is possible for adults to be women (e.g., an adult woman is not a man, satisfying Premise 2, and she is a woman, but Premise 1 does not contradict this as it only addresses men not being women).\n   - Therefore, the conclusion that no adult is a woman does not necessarily follow from the premises, as there could be adult women who exist without violating either premise.\n4.
